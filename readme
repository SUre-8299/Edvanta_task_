1. Overview:

The Basic Code Editor is a simple web-based application that provides users with the capability to practice and preview HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. It offers a split-screen interface where users can type in their code on one side and see the live rendered output on the other.

2. Code Editor Section:

Split into three textareas, each dedicated to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript respectively.
Users can write their code within these textareas.
Each textarea has real-time update functionality (on input) and a custom tab key handling to maintain the code indentation within them.
The update function takes care of rendering the combined HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into an iframe. This allows users to see live previews of their code.
Live Preview Section:

An iframe is used to display the output of the code written in the editor.
As users type or make changes in any of the textareas, the live preview gets updated, giving instant feedback.


4. Action Buttons:

Copy Button: Copies the content from the textareas.
Save Button: A placeholder for a save action. In the current implementation, it just alerts the user but can be extended to save the code to a backend server or a file.
Lock Button: Allows users to lock or unlock the textareas. When locked, the textareas become read-only, preventing further edits.


5. Technology Stack:

HTML: Provides the structure of the web application.
CSS: (Not provided in the snippet) Would be responsible for styling and designing the layout of the code editor.
JavaScript: Enables dynamic interactions in the web application like toggling the navbar, live updating the iframe content, handling textarea tabs, copying content, and locking the textareas.
Split.js: An external library that seems to be linked to the project, presumably to handle the split-screen functionality.


use the dummy content

<!-- <div class="customDiv" id="dynamicDiv">
    Click to change my color!
</div> -->

<!-- .customDiv {
    width: 200px;
    height: 100px;
    border: 1px solid black;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    cursor: pointer;
} -->

<!-- document.getElementById('dynamicDiv').addEventListener('click', function() {
    // Generate a random color
    const randomColor = '#' + Math.floor(Math.random()*16777215).toString(16);
    this.style.backgroundColor = randomColor;
}); -->
